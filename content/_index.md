## Scope

The IWAHPCE aims to provide the opportunity to share the practice and experience of high-performance computing systems using the Arm architecture and their performance and applications.The last few years have seen an explosion of 64-bit Arm-based processors targeted toward server and infrastructure workloads, often specializing in a specific domain such as HPC, cloud, and machine learning. Fujitsu’s A64FX and Marvell’s ThunderX2 have been used in several large-scale HPC systems, and Amazon’s Graviton2 has been adopted by Amazon EC2. Moreover, Amazon’s Graviton3, NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip, and SiPearl’s Rhea system-on-chip are recently announced or become accessible.Sharing the practice and experiences using these Arm-based processors will contribute to advancing high-performance computing technology for newly designed systems using these new emerging Arm-based processors.

The IWAHPCE 2026 workshop will be held in conjunction with the [SCA/HPC Asia 2026](https://www.sca-hpcasia2026.jp/) conference in Osaka, Japan. All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library within the SCA/HPC Asia 2026 common workshops proceedings.

## Topics 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
- HPC Applications
- Performance Analysis, Performance Modeling & Measurement
- SVE Vectorization analysis
- Programming Models & System Softoware
- Networking and accelerators such as GPUs
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- Emerging Technologies

## Paper Submission

All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. The following paper categories are welcome:
- Full papers Manuscripts must be at most 18 pages in one-column submission PDF format including figures and references
- Short papers Manuscripts must be at most 10 pages in one-column submission PDF format including figures and references
  
The paper format is described in the [Paper Submission](https://www.sca-hpcasia2026.jp/submit/papers.html) section of SCA/HPC Asia 2026 website. Fore more detail, please refer https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions.

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by the PC members. The review process is double-blind, please do not include the name of authors, etc.
